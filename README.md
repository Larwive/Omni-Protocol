# Omni-Protocol
A protocol that can be used to do anything from sharing files to stream live in a peer-to-peer network.

Inspired by `TeemoP2P` available at https://github.com/Bugz-gg/TeemoP2P.

The main differences between these two repositories is the implemented protocol and language.
Here, everything will be written in C.
